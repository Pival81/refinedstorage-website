## Uncrafting a Fluid Storage Disk

When the Fluid Storage Disk is empty, the player can retrieve the [Fluid Storage Part](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Fluid-Storage-Part) of the Fluid Storage Disk by selecting it and right clicking while sneaking.

The player will also receive a [Storage Housing](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Storage-Housing).
