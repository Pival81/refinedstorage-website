# Crafting Grid

The Crafting Grid is the same as a regular [Grid](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Grid), but there is a handy crafting inventory too.

When something is crafted, it won't just clear the crafting slots, but it'll try to retrieve the same items from the system again.

Items from the crafting slots can be shift clicked into the system.

When using shift it will try to keep getting items from the system and crafting until 64 items are crafted.

The Crafting Grid integrates with JEI (Just Enough Items) so the player can use recipe transferring.
