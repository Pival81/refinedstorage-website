# Crafter

A crafter is a block that crafts items with [Patterns](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Pattern). It can take [Speed Upgrades](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Speed-Upgrade) to increase the crafting speed.

With [Patterns](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Pattern#processing-pattern) meant for machine automation, the Crafter has to face the correct input side of the machine.

## Triggering crafting tasks with a redstone signal

It is also possible to trigger crafting tasks with a redstone signal by toggling "Trigger autocrafting with redstone signal" to "On".

Then, the Crafter will schedule task(s) for all the patterns in it if a task for those patterns isn't running yet.
