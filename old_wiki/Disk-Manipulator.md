# Disk Manipulator

The Disk Manipulator is a block that adds a fast way of transferring items between storage disks and the network.

It can take a Item Storage Disk and a Fluid Storage Disk.

The player can configure the block to have a certain whitelist or blacklist of items that can be transferred, and set NBT / damage comparison.

The player can also choose whether to insert items to the system or extract items from the system.
