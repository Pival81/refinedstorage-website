## About

#### Refined Storage is an Applied Energistics 1 style mod for Minecraft 1.10.2.

Refined Storage gives players access to all their items at once. These items are stored safely in one of the many storage capabilities that the mod offers.

The mod is not only used to get access to items in one handy interface, but also to manipulate items and blocks in the world and from the system with importers, exporters, constructors, destructors and more!

Refined Storage takes the storage aspect of the mod one step further by allowing the player to set up autocrafting.

The mod not only stores your items, but has fluid storage as well!
