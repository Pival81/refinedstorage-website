# RS energy

Refined Storage uses RS as its power unit.

There is no way to generate RS.

RS is just a middleman for all the different power systems.

When you supply the [Controller](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Controller) or [Wireless Grid](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Wireless-Grid) with one of the supported energy systems, Refined Storage will automatically convert it to RS units.
