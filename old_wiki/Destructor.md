# Destructor

The Destructor destroys blocks or fluids in front of it and puts the drops in the storage system.

If there is no space in the system to push the drops, it'll drop them in the world.

The Destructor has the ability to only break certain blocks, with the whitelist and blacklist option. Said whitelist and blacklist can be NBT, damage or oredict sensitive.

The Destructor can also pick up items in the world instead of destroying blocks.

The Destructor can also be upgraded with the [Fortune Upgrade](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Fortune-Upgrade) or [Silk Touch Upgrade](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Silk-Touch-Upgrade).
