# Interdimensional Upgrade

The Interdimensional Upgrade is an upgrade that allows the [Network Transmitter](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Network-Transmitter) to work cross-dimensionally.

It takes 2 Nether Stars to create the upgrade.

Do note that this upgrade does take a lot of extra RS/t by default (1000 RS/t extra).
