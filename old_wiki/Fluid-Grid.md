# Fluid Grid

The Fluid Grid is the same as a regular [Grid](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Grid), but is used for viewing fluids from the fluid storage.

Players can extract the fluid by clicking on it. The Fluid Grid will then fill a bucket with the selected liquid. Refined Storage will first search an empty bucket from your storage system. If none is found, a bucket will be searched in your inventory.

Some fluids cannot be canned in a bucket, then the only way to extract said fluid is by using an [Exporter](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Exporter).

To insert a fluid, players can shift click or just click in a filled bucket.
