# Wireless Transmitter

The Wireless Transmitter is used to send signals to [Wireless Grids](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Wireless-Grid).

The default range is 16 blocks, but can be upgraded with [Range Upgrades](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Range-Upgrade).

Placing 2 Wireless Transmitters next to each other for example will not do that much. The wireless signal starts from the Wireless Transmitter position, so if you place 2 transmitters next to each other you'll only have a net gain of 1 block.

Instead, you have to spread out your Wireless Transmitters around the world.

**Keep in mind that you have to place the Wireless Transmitter on a cable!**
