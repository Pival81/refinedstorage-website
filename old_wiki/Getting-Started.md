# Getting Started

## Recommended mods
Make sure you have JEI (Just Enough Items) installed so you can see the [Solderer](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Solderer) recipes.

## Items required

A big amount of iron and quartz is required throughout the mod.

A decent amount of diamonds and gold is also required for some items.

## A minimal setup

### Step 1: The Controller

Craft the [Controller](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Controller).

The [Controller](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Controller) is the "master" of the storage network.

This is the block where you'll be giving [RS energy](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/RS-energy) to.

### Step 2: The Solderer

To make some of the items and blocks in the next step you'll need to craft the [Solderer](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Solderer).

The [Solderer](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Solderer) is the crafting mechanic Refined Storage uses for a bunch of items and blocks.

Connect the [Solderer](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Solderer) to the [Controller](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Controller) by placing it next to it, or by connecting it through [Cable](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Cable).

Make sure the [Controller](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Controller) has [RS energy](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/RS-energy)!

### Step 3: Storage and accessing your items

Craft a [Disk Drive](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Disk-Drive) and a [1k Storage Disk](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Storage-Disk) to store your items.

Put the [1k Storage Disk](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Storage-Disk) in the [Disk Drive](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Disk-Drive).

Craft a [Grid](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Grid) to access your items.

Connect those blocks to the [Controller](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Controller) with [Cable](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Cable), but you can also just place them next to each other in any direction.

### Step 4: Done!

You are now able to insert and extract items in the [Grid](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Grid)!

## What next?

To fully understand all the blocks and items of the mod a readthrough of all the wiki pages is recommended.
