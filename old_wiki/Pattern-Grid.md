# Pattern Grid

The Pattern Grid is the same as a regular [Grid](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Grid), but also allows for the creation of [Patterns](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Pattern).

It is only possible to create normal crafting patterns with this block, not patterns used for machine automation, use the [Processing Pattern Encoder](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Processing-Pattern-Encoder) for that.

The Pattern Grid integrates with JEI (Just Enough Items) so the player can use recipe transferring.
