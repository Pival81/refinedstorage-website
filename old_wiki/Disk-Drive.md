# Disk Drive

The Disk Drive is a block that has one goal: provide storage to the system.

One can insert [Storage Disks](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Storage-Disk) or [Fluid Storage Disks](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Fluid-Storage-Disk) in the inventory slots and those disks will be used to put the items or fluids on.

A (negative or positive) priority can be chosen (where a higher priority gets higher precedence to place items in).

There is also a whitelist and blacklist to only allow or forbid some items or fluids from entering the [Storage Disks](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Storage-Disk) or [Fluid Storage Disks](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Fluid-Storage-Disk) respectively.

It is also possible to void excess items or fluids entering the disks.

The default access type is extract and insert mode, but, it can be toggled to only allow insertions or only extractions as well.
