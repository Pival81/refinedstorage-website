# Stack Upgrade

The Stack upgrade will import or export a whole stack (64 items) instead of 1 item per update.

It can be combined with [Speed Upgrades](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Speed-Upgrade) to let the machine go to the next slot quicker.

By using this upgrade, the amount of RS/t that this machine draws will increase.
