# Interface

The Interface acts as an interface between the world and the system.

It acts as an inventory so pipes from other mods or hoppers can put items in the system (if there is a space).

There is also an option for exporting items from the system.

To clear an exported item configuration use shift and click on the item to clear. Use the left and right mouse buttons to increment or decrement the amount that has to be exported.
