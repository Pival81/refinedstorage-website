# Network Card

A Network Card is an item that stores the coordinates of a [Network Receiver](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Network-Receiver).

The player has to insert the Network Card in a [Network Transmitter](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Network-Transmitter).
