# Storage Block

The Storage Block is a block that provides the system with storage. It is similar to [Storage Disks](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Storage-Disk), but can be placed in the world.

A (negative or positive) priority can be chosen (where a higher priority gets higher precedence to place items in).

There is also a whitelist and blocklist option to only allow or forbid some items from entering the Storage Block.

Every Storage Block has an option to void excess items.

When breaking the Storage Block, the items that it holds persist, so you won't lose any of your items.

The default access type is extract and insert mode, but, it can be toggled to only allow insertions or only extractions as well.

## Types of Storage Blocks

## Uncrafting a Storage Block

When the Storage Block is empty, the player can retrieve the [Storage Part](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Storage-Part), the [Basic Processor](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Processor) and the [Machine Casing](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Machine-Casing) back by selecting it and right clicking while sneaking.
