# Exporter

The Exporter extracts items or fluids from the system and inserts it in the inventory in front of it.

Before being able to export anything, the player has to choose the items or fluids to export.

The Exporter should face the block it's exporting to in a way that the wanted slot or fluid tank is possible to reach from that side.
