# Processing Pattern Encoder

A Processing Pattern Encoder is used to create [Patterns](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Pattern) meant for machine automation.

To create regular crafting patterns, use a [Pattern Grid](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/refinedstorage/wiki/Pattern-Grid).

It takes up to 9 inputs and 9 outputs, so the storage system knows what to take and what to expect.

It is possible to use JEI transferring to transfer the inputs and outputs.

This block does not have to be connected to a storage network.
