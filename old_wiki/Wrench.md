# Wrench

The Wrench is a tool in Refined Storage that has 2 modes. To toggle the mode, right click with the item in hand.

## Rotation mode

This mode will rotate any block. Use SHIFT + right click to rotate.

## Configuration mode

This mode will save configurations of Refined Storage machines to the wrench, and said configuration can be copied over to other machines as well.

Use SHIFT + right click on the machine to save the configuration, and use SHIFT + right click again on another machine (of the same type) to write the configuration.

To clear the configuration, switch to rotation mode.
